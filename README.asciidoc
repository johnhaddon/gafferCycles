== Setup ==

- Download https://github.com/ImageEngine/gaffer/releases[latest Gaffer binary release]
- Make sure python/GafferCycles is on the PYTHONPATH. Make sure startup/gui is on the GAFFER_STARTUP_PATHS.

== Use ==

Create a Cycles/Render node from the node menu, and feed in a scene. Executing this node will create an XML scene file in Cycles format. This can then be rendered using cycles standalone.

== Limitations ==

Currently only polygon meshes and the main render camera are exported.
